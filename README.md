# apollo-11

### We choose to go to the moon...
...and then come back, and then go to the moon, and then back again-- not because it is easy, **because it is comfortable.**

Apollo-11 is an interface for getting an AST from [full-moon](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/full-moon) back on the cozy home planet of the Luau environment you know and love-- with the cold reaches of space and [all of its hazards](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html) far gone.
Send a script's source code over using HTTPService, get the AST back, modify it in Luau, send it back over to full-moon, and get the new source code back.
